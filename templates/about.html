    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided
    to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also
    believed
    that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious
    Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business,
    welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.
